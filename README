Hello World!
This is my practice with Rebase, Merge, and Diff conflicts.


- What ***git*** command creates a branch?
- git branch <branch name>
- What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
- Fast forward Merge is when the feature has changed but the master branch has not. This moves the head to the the last feature and merges the tip with the Master.
- What ***git*** command changes to another branch?
- git switch or git checkout
- What ***git*** command deletes a branch?
- git <branch> -d 
- git <branch> -D to force delete unmerged branches
- How do merge conflicts happen?
- When 2 copies of files have changes to the same content. The conflict must be resolved manually.
