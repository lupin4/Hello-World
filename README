# # Hello World!


This is my practice with Rebase, Merge, and Diff conflicts.

- What git command creates a branch?
  - `git branch <branch-name>`

- What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
  - Fast-forward Merge is when the feature branch has changed, but the master branch has not. This moves the head to the last feature commit and merges the tip with the master.

- What git command changes to another branch?
  - `git switch` or `git checkout`

- What git command deletes a branch?
  - `git branch -d <branch>`
  - `git branch -D <branch>` to force delete unmerged branches

- How do merge conflicts happen?
  - When two copies of files have changes to the same content. The conflict must be resolved manually.
